LaTeX templates for my common documents

## Contents

### `learning-objectives`

A template for mapping out learning objectives for a course.  This template uses a
*Strand* > *Threshold* > *Objective* model and provides commands to make this easier.

### `problemsets`

The `problemset.cls` is a LaTeX class for writing problemsets or notes.  It includes a
custom `\question` enumerate environment ideal for inclass problemsets.  It also
includes some pretty `\begin{theorem}` and `\begin{definition}` environments, making it
suitable for authoring class notes as well.

### `syllabus`

My attempt at building a visually attractive and professional-looking syllabus.
